# Main Module(XmlDsl)

## Overview

The main module of the project is the root module of the project.
It contains the main application, and command line interfaces.

## Structure

`src/main/kotlin` is main source directory of the module, use Kotlin language to write the code.
If you need to write tests, use `src/test/kotlin` directory.

Also, you can write the code in Java language, but it is not recommended.
If you need to write the code in Java, use `src/main/java` and `src/test/java` directories.
